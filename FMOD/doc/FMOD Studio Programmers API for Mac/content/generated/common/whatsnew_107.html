<h1>What's New in 1.07</h1>

<p>This section describes the major features introduced in the 1.07 release.  See the
<a href="revision.html">Detailed Revision History</a> for information regarding each patch release.</p>

<h2>64-bit version of Studio</h2>

<p>Studio is now a 64-bit application, providing greater memory capacity and improved performance.
On Windows, separate 32-bit and 64-bit versions are available. On Mac, Studio is now 64-bit only.</p>

<p>All plugin libraries must be built for 64-bit architecture in order to be compatible with
the 64-bit version of Studio.</p>

<h2>Nested events have been converted to reference events</h2>

<p>The concept of nested events and referenced events has been unified to just having reference 
events.  As part of this change, <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_Bank_GetEventCount.html">Studio::Bank::getEventCount</A> and <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_Bank_GetEventList.html">Studio::Bank::getEventList</A> now
only return top level events that have been explicitly added to banks by the sound designer.
They do not include any reference events that have been included in the bank implicitly via 
event instrument references.</p>

<h2>Bus Polyphony</h2>

<p>This setting allows the designer to set a limit on the number of event instances that route through a bus.</p>

<h2>Improved recording and enumeration support</h2>

<p>When using <A HREF="../FMOD_System_GetRecordNumDrivers.html">System::getRecordNumDrivers</A> and <A HREF="../FMOD_System_GetRecordDriverInfo.html">System::getRecordDriverInfo</A> you can now be sure that
a particular list index will always be valid. As devices are added the list will grow over time,
if a device is removed it will remain in the list. You can now query <A HREF="../FMOD_DRIVER_STATE.html">FMOD_DRIVER_STATE</A> to 
determine <A HREF="../FMOD_DRIVER_STATE.html">FMOD_DRIVER_STATE_CONNECTED</A>.</p>

<p>To take advantage of these improvements all major platforms support dynamic device addition and
removal allowing developers to query the current state of all recording hardware. For notifications
about changes <A HREF="../FMOD_System_SetCallback.html">System::setCallback</A> can be used with <A HREF="../FMOD_SYSTEM_CALLBACK_TYPE.html">FMOD_SYSTEM_CALLBACK_RECORDLISTCHANGED</A>. All
recording device changes are now decoupled from output changes.</p>

<h2>Multi-channel compressed sample support</h2>

<p>In previous versions of FMOD multi-channel (greater than stereo) sounds could be streamed or played
after being decompressed into memory, but not as an in memory compressed sound (ie Vorbis).
This release allows any FSB compressed sound to be multi-channel, accessible via 
<A HREF="../FMOD_MODE.html">FMOD_CREATECOMPRESSEDSAMPLE</A> flag if using the low level API, or just drag and drop multi-channel 
sounds into FMOD Studio's UI and play as normal.</p>

<h2>Added <A HREF="../FMOD_DSP_TYPE.html">FMOD_DSP_TYPE_CHANNELMIX</A> effect</h2>

<p>This new DSP effect allows the user to control gain levels for up to 32 input channel signals, and pipe
the output to a range of speaker formats i.e. repeating mono, stereo, quad, 5.1, 7.1 or only LFE out.</p>

<h2>Performance improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Improved Vorbis decoding performance on Windows.</li>
<li>Metering / Profiling performance significantly improved.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Platform specific improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li>New platforms - Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and AppleTV support.</li>
<li>Mac - Added support for recording from multiple microphones at the same time.</li>
<li>iOS - Added support for bitcode.</li>
<li>Win - Reduced dll and exe sizes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New Plugins</h2>

<ul>
<li>AudioGaming - AudioMotors.  Create realtime interactive car engine sounds from a single recorded engine sweep!</li>
<li>Two Big Ears - 3DCEPTION.  3Dception is a real-time 3D audio and environmental modelling engine. </li>
</ul>

<h1>What's new since 1.06 initial release</h1>

<p>This section covers some of the improvements introduced between the first 1.06 release and the new 1.07 release.</p>

<ul>
<li>Internet streams.  Add Sound::setPosition and <A HREF="../FMOD_Sound_SeekData.html">Sound::seekData</A> support for HTTP streams.</li>
<li>UE4 - Added blueprint functions for loading and unloading sample data, new initialization settings, beat and marker callbacks as Blueprint events, reverb zones, and 4.9 engine preview build.</li>
<li>Studio Profiler now shows nested instance information.</li>
<li>Reduced memory overhead of bank metadata.</li>
<li><A HREF="../FMOD_STUDIO_LOAD_BANK_FLAGS.html">FMOD_STUDIO_LOAD_BANK_DECOMPRESS_SAMPLES</A> flag has been added to allow compressed banks to be decompressed at load time, to help low spec machines.</li>
<li>Tempo and marker event callbacks added to Studio API.  See <A HREF="../FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_TYPE.html">FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_TIMELINE_MARKER</A> and <A HREF="../FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_TYPE.html">FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_TIMELINE_BEAT</A>.</li>
<li>Additional event callback types: <A HREF="../FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_TYPE.html">FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_CREATED</A>, <A HREF="../FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_TYPE.html">FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_DESTROYED</A> and  <A HREF="../FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_TYPE.html">FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_START_FAILED</A>.</li>
<li><A HREF="../FMOD_DSP_COMPRESSOR.html">FMOD_DSP_COMPRESSOR</A> now supports unlinked channel compression, so multichannel sidechaining for example can compress each destination channel individually.</li>
<li>DSP Plugin writers - FMOD_DSP_DESCRIPTION::sys_register, sys_deregister and sys_mix callbacks have been added, to allow a per type (not instance) level init/shutdown/mix callback for a plugin.</li>
</ul>
