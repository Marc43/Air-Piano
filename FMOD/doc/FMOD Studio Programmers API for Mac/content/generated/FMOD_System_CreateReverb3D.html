<H1>System::createReverb3D</H1>
<P>
<p>Creates a 'virtual reverb' object.  This object reacts to 3D location and morphs the reverb environment based on how close it is to the reverb object's center.<br>
Multiple reverb objects can be created to achieve a multi-reverb environment.  1 Physical reverb object is used for all 3D reverb objects (slot 0 by default).</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl>
<dt>reverb</dt>
<dd>Address of a pointer to a Reverb object to receive the newly created virtual reverb object.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Return Values</h2><P>
If the function succeeds then the return value is <A HREF="FMOD_RESULT.html">FMOD_OK</A>.<BR>
If the function fails then the return value will be one of the values defined in the <A HREF="FMOD_RESULT.html">FMOD_RESULT</A> enumeration.<BR>
</P>
<h2>Remarks</h2><P>
<p>The 3D reverb object is a sphere having 3D attributes (position, minimum distance, maximum distance) and reverb properties.<br>
The properties and 3D attributes of all reverb objects collectively determine, along with the listener's position, the settings of and input gains into a single 3D reverb DSP.<br>
When the listener is within the sphere of effect of one or more 3D reverbs, the listener's 3D reverb properties are a weighted combination of such 3D reverbs.<br>
When the listener is outside all of the reverbs, no reverb is applied.</p>

<p>In FMOD Ex a special 'ambient' reverb setting was used when outside the influence of all reverb spheres.   This function no longer exists.<br>
In FMOD Studio <A HREF="FMOD_System_SetReverbProperties.html">System::setReverbProperties</A> can be used to create an alternative reverb that can be used for 2D and background global reverb.<br>
To avoid this reverb intefering with the reverb slot used by the 3D reverb, 2D reverb should use a different slot id with <A HREF="FMOD_System_SetReverbProperties.html">System::setReverbProperties</A>, otherwise FMOD_ADVANCEDSETTINGS::reverb3Dinstance can also be used to place 3D reverb on a different physical reverb slot.
Use <A HREF="FMOD_Channel_SetReverbProperties.html">Channel::setReverbProperties</A> or <A HREF="FMOD_ChannelGroup_SetReverbProperties.html">ChannelGroup::setReverbProperties</A> to turn off reverb for 2D sounds (ie set wet = 0).</p>

<p>Creating multiple reverb objects does not impact performance.  These are 'virtual reverbs'.  There will still be only 1 physical reverb DSP running that just morphs between the different virtual reverbs.</p>

<p>Note about phsyical reverb DSP unit allocation.  To remove the DSP unit and the associated CPU cost, first make sure all 3D reverb objects are released.  Then call <A HREF="FMOD_System_SetReverbProperties.html">System::setReverbProperties</A> with the 3D reverb's slot ID (default is 0) with a property point of 0 or NULL, to signal that the physical reverb instance should be deleted.<br>
If a 3D reverb is still present, and <A HREF="FMOD_System_SetReverbProperties.html">System::setReverbProperties</A> function is called to free the physical reverb, the 3D reverb system will immediately recreate it upon the next <A HREF="FMOD_System_Update.html">System::update</A> call.</p>
