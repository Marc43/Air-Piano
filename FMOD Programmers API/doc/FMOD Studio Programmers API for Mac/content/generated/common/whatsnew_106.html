<h1>What's New in 1.06</h1>

<p>This section describes the major features introduced in the 1.06 release.  See the
<a href="revision.html">Detailed Revision History</a> for information regarding each patch release.</p>

<h2>Bank Loading Changes</h2>

<p>Studio now does all file loading on a separate loading thread.  This avoids any hitches
in scheduling that may occur when loading large banks.  The interface is unchanged since
the <A HREF="../FMOD_STUDIO_LOAD_BANK_FLAGS.html">FMOD_STUDIO_LOAD_BANK_NONBLOCKING</A> flag already exists.</p>

<p>Banks loaded with <A HREF="../FMOD_STUDIO_LOAD_BANK_FLAGS.html">FMOD_STUDIO_LOAD_BANK_NONBLOCKING</A> will no longer be destroyed if the loading
fails, instead they will remain in an error state that can be queried with 
<A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_Bank_GetLoadingState.html">Studio::Bank::getLoadingState</A>.  Banks that enter the error state should be released by calling
<A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_Bank_Unload.html">Studio::Bank::unload</A>.</p>

<p>Several enhancements were made for <A HREF="../FMOD_STUDIO_LOAD_MEMORY_MODE.html">FMOD_STUDIO_LOAD_MEMORY_POINT</A>.  Extra data can be 
associated with the bank by <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_Bank_GetUserData.html">Studio::Bank::getUserData</A> and <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_Bank_SetUserData.html">Studio::Bank::setUserData</A>.  There
is a new callback <A HREF="../FMOD_STUDIO_SYSTEM_CALLBACK_TYPE.html">FMOD_STUDIO_SYSTEM_CALLBACK_BANK_UNLOAD</A> which is called when banks are 
asynchronously unloaded.  That provides a convenient place to free any memory associated with 
the bank.</p>

<p>The load_banks example has been updated to demonstrate all the methods of loading banks.</p>

<h2>API Capture and Replay</h2>

<p>API command capture functionality has been improved.  API commands are now captured when recording
a profiling session in Studio, allowing sound designers to create API command captures without
the need for programmer support.</p>

<p>API captures now write out the initial state of the playback system including currently loaded
banks as well as the state of all created event instances.  This allows API captures to be 
taken mid-game without missing any information.</p>

<p><A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_System_LoadCommandReplay.html">Studio::System::loadCommandReplay</A> now returns a CommandReplay object that has functionality
for querying information as well as starting, stopping, and pausing playback.  Playback is now
asynchronous.</p>

<h2>Multiple listener support</h2>

<p>The Studio API has been updated to support multiple listeners.  <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_System_SetNumListeners.html">Studio::System::setNumListeners</A>
and <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_System_GetNumListeners.html">Studio::System::getNumListeners</A> has been added, and the existing 
<A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_System_SetListenerAttributes.html">Studio::System::setListenerAttributes</A> and <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_System_GetListenerAttributes.html">Studio::System::getListenerAttributes</A> functions now
take a listener index.</p>

<p>Doppler is disabled when in multiple listener mode.</p>

<p>As part of this change, there is a new DSP data parameter <A HREF="../FMOD_DSP_PARAMETER_3DATTRIBUTES_MULTI.html">FMOD_DSP_PARAMETER_3DATTRIBUTES_MULTI</A> that
can be used for DSP panners that want to support multiple listener panning.</p>

<h2>FADPCM Compression</h2>

<p>This new compression format is recommended for all developers targeting mobile devices, PS Vita
or Wii U and is considered a drop in replacement for IMA ADPCM compression. It achieves a
slightly higher compression ratio, 3.66:1 compared with 3.55:1 while being a step up in quality.
However the main benefit of this new custom format is the ground up design for efficient
decoding, in some cases twice as fast as IMA ADPCM.</p>
