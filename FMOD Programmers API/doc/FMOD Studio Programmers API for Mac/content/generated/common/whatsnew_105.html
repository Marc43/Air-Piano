<h1>What's New in 1.05</h1>

<p>This section describes the major features introduced in the 1.05 release.  See the
<a href="revision.html">Detailed Revision History</a> for information regarding each patch release.</p>

<h2>MixerStrip Replaced by Bus and VCA</h2>

<p>The Studio::MixerStrip class has been replaced by Studio::Bus and Studio::VCA to better reflect the differences
between the two concepts. The new classes do not have a release method, as their handles remain valid until the bank
containing them is unloaded.</p>

<h2>Get Event functions</h2>

<p>The <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_System_GetEvent.html">Studio::System::getEvent</A>, <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_System_GetBus.html">Studio::System::getBus</A>, <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_System_GetVCA.html">Studio::System::getVCA</A> and <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_System_GetBank.html">Studio::System::getBank</A> functions
now take a string that can either be the full path or the string representation of the ID.  This avoids the
additional call to <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_ParseID.html">Studio::parseID</A> or <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_System_LookupID.html">Studio::System::lookupID</A> in most cases.</p>

<p>The functions to get by ID are now named <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_System_GetEventByID.html">Studio::System::getEventByID</A>, 
<A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_System_GetBusByID.html">Studio::System::getBusByID</A>, <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_System_GetVCAByID.html">Studio::System::getVCAByID</A>, and <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_System_GetBankByID.html">Studio::System::getBankByID</A>.</p>

<h2>Bus ChannelGroup Lifetime</h2>

<p>Each bus's channelgroup is now created and destroyed on demand. This means it only exists if at least one event
instance routes into the bus. If it doesn't exist, <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_Bus_GetChannelGroup.html">Studio::Bus::getChannelGroup</A> will return <A HREF="../FMOD_RESULT.html">FMOD_ERR_STUDIO_NOT_LOADED</A>.</p>

<h2>Event Instance Release Behavior Change</h2>

<p><A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_EventInstance_Release.html">Studio::EventInstance::release</A> no longer invalidates the handle immediately. Instead, the handle remains valid until
the instance stops and is actually destroyed. In addition, this function no longer checks if the event will stop
naturally. Looping events will not be destroyed until they are manually stopped.</p>

<p>This change also means that event callbacks will continue to be fired after <A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_EventInstance_Release.html">Studio::EventInstance::release</A> is called
until the instance is actually destroyed. This can be prevented by setting the callback to NULL before calling
<A HREF="../FMOD_Studio_EventInstance_Release.html">Studio::EventInstance::release</A>.</p>

<h2>Event Stop Behavior Change</h2>

<p>Events with sounds triggered by parameters will now stop once all sounds have finished and the timeline cursor has
reached the end. Previously these events would go idle instead of stopping. The old behavior can be achieved by adding
a sustain point to the timeline.</p>

<h2>Deprecated Function Removed</h2>

<p>Studio::EventInstance::createSubEvent has been removed. Use Event Sounds instead.</p>

<h2>Wide String API</h2>

<p>All FMOD functions dealing with file names and paths now accept UTF-8 encoded strings. All arguments that take or
return UTF-16 encoded strings have been removed, as have flags that indicate an UTF-16 string has been passed.</p>

<p>UTF-8 encoded strings can be used to access file paths containing non-ASCII characters on Windows, PS3, PS4, PS Vita, 
XBox One, iOS, Android, Mac, Linux, Windows Phone, and Windows Store.</p>

<h2>Added AAC Support for Android</h2>

<p>It is now possible to load AAC files on Android 4.2 or newer devices. This can make use of any hardware accelerated 
decoding provided by the platform.</p>

<h2>Improved Logging Output</h2>

<p>For greater control of the logging version of FMOD, i.e. fmodL / fmodstudioL you can now use FMOD::Debug_Initialize
to specify both logging level and destination. By default all output will go to the TTY / stderr / logcat / platform
specific debug location. Using this new API you can also send output to file or callback for integration into custom
logging systems.</p>

<h2>DSP Reset Callback Behavior Clarified</h2>

<p>The <A HREF="../FMOD_DSP_RESET_CALLBACK.html">FMOD_DSP_RESET_CALLBACK</A> documentation has been updated to make it clear that it should leave public parameters
unchanged.</p>
