<h1>Record example</h1>

<p>This example shows how to record continuously and play back the same data while
keeping a specified latency between the two. This is achieved by delaying the
start of playback until the specified number of milliseconds has been recorded.
At runtime the playback speed will be slightly altered to compensate for any
drift in either play or record drivers.</p>

<h3>Location</h3>

<p>The example is located at api/lowlevel/examples/record.cpp.</p>
