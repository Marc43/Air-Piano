<h1>Record enumeration example</h1>

<p>This example shows how to enumerate the available recording drivers on this
device. It demonstrates how the enumerated list changes as microphones are
attached and detached. It also shows that you can record from multi mics at
the same time.</p>

<p>Please note to minimize latency care should be taken to control the number
of samples between the record position and the play position. Check the record
example for details on this process.</p>
