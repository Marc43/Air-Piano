<h1>Object Panning Example</h1>

<p>This example demonstrates the FMOD object panner. The usage is completely
transparent to the API, the only difference is how the event is authored in the
FMOD Studio tool.</p>

<p>To hear the difference between object panning and normal panning this example
has two events (one configured with the normal panner, and one with the object
panner). As they move around the listener you may toggle between panning method
and two different sounds.</p>

<p>Object panning requires compatible hardware such as a Dolby Atmos amplifier or
a Playstation VR headset. For cases when the necessary hardware is not available
FMOD will fallback to standard 3D panning.</p>

<p>NOTE! Currently the Atmos output mode requires a dll to be supplied via support.
Atmos access needs to be granted via Dolby first.  Write to support@fmod.com 
for more.</p>
